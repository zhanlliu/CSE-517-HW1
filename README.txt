Codes are written using the Jupyternotebook. Results will be printed by running all the codes in sequence.

The codes covered three main parts:
1 Data manipulations including adding start symbols and end symbols and handle low frequent words in training set and out of vocabulary words in dev and test set.  
2 Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram models. Perplexity on train, dev, and test set are reported separately. 
3 Trigram with add-k smooting or linear interpolation. Hyper-parameters are choosen based on the performance of the perplexity score on the dev set.
